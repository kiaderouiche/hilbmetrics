## What the Hilbert projective metric ?

In mathematics, the Hilbert metric, also known as the Hilbert projective 
metric, is an explicitly defined distance function on a bounded convex 
subset of the n-dimensional Euclidean space R^n.
It was introduced by David Hilbert (1895) as a generalization of the 
Cayley's formula for the distance in the Cayley–Klein model of hyperbolic 
geometry, where the convex set is the n-dimensional open unit ball.
Hilbert's metric has been applied to Perron–Frobenius theory and 
constructing Gromov hyperbolic spaces.
